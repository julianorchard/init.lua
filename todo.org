* Todo items for the neovim config

** TODO Explore neovim org properly
   It looks really good but at the moment I'm comparing it with the (easier)
   OOTB experience of Emacs

*** TODO Managing lists
*** TODO Clocking
*** TODO Capture
*** TODO Agenda

*** NOTES
    Everything is prefixed with =<leader>o=, so:
    =<leader>oa= is the Agenda
    =<leader>oc= is the Capture

** TODO Jsonnet to generate my snippets
   Because fun
